/**
 * Controls the acknowledgment of write operations with various options.
 *
 * ==`w`==
 * - 0: Don't wait for acknowledgement from the server
 * - 1: Wait for acknowledgement, but don't wait for secondaries to replicate
 * - >=2: Wait for one or more secondaries to also acknowledge
 *
 * ==`wtimeout` - how long to wait for slaves before failing ==
 * - 0: indefinite
 * - >0: time to wait in milliseconds
 *
 * ==Other options:==
 *
 * - `j`: If true block until write operations have been committed to the journal. Cannot be used in combination with
 *    `fsync`. Prior to MongoDB 2.6 this option was ignored if the server was running without journaling.
 *    Starting with MongoDB 2.6 write operations will fail with an exception if this option is used when the server
 *    is running without journaling.
 * - `fsync`: If true and the server is running without journaling, blocks until the server has synced all data files to disk.
 *    If the server is running with journaling, this acts the same as the `j` option, blocking until write operations have been
 *    committed to the journal. Cannot be used in combination with `j`. In almost all cases the `j` flag should be used in
 *    preference to this one.
